  <h1 style="font-size:50px">Sir Jagdish Chandra Bose</h1>
  <br><br>
  <p>Jagadis Chandra Bose, popularly known as J.C. Bose, occupies a unique position in history of modern Indian science. He is regarded as India’s first modern scientist. One of Bose’s biographers, Subrata Dasgupta, writes : <b>“Bose was the first Indian to be admitted in person to the sanctum sanctorum of English, thus western science”.</b> In January 1897 Bose delivered a lecture at the Royal Institution, London, a Friday Evening Discourse, then most prestigious and visible platform for announcing new discoveries, in which Bose demonstrated his devices for the generation and detection of radio waves.</p>

  <p>Jagadis Chandra Bose was born in Mymensingh, in his mother’s parental house, now in Bangladesh on 30th November 1858, the same year in which India, which was being administered by the East India Company since 1757, came directly under crown rule. Lord Canning, Governor General, as the East India Company’s Chief Administrator of India used to be called since 1772 when Warren Hastings assumed the office, was proclaimed Viceroy. Bose’s ancestral home was at the village named Rarikhal in Vikrampur.</p>

  <p>Bose started his education in a vernacular or Bengali School, a pathsala, which was founded by his father in Faridpur. It may be noted that Bhagaban Chandra could have easily sent his son to the local English School. However, he wanted his son to learn his mother tongue and know his own culture before he learned English and knew the foreign culture. In this Pathasala Bose studied with the children of peasants, fishermen and workers. In their company Bose imbibed a love of nature. Bose often attended Jatras (folk plays) in village fairs and which inspired him to read the great epics, Mahabharata and Ramayana. The character of Karna in Mahabharata influenced him deeply. To quote Bose: “From his (Karna’s) low caste came rejection, came every disadvantage; but he always played and fought fair! So his life, though a series of disappointments and defeats to the very end – his slaying by Arjuna– appealed to me as a boy as the greatest of triumphs. I still think of the tournament where Arjuna had been victor, and then of Karna coming as a stranger to challenge him. Questioned of name and birth, he replies, “I am my own ancestor! You do not ask the might Ganges from which of its many springs itcomes: its own flow justifies itself, so shall my deeds me!’ Further he wrote : <b>“Like that of my boyhood’s hero Karna, my life has been ever one of combat and must be to the last. It is not for man to complain of circumstances, but bravely to accept, to confront, and to dominate them.”</b></p>

  <p>In 1869 Bose was sent to Kolkata (then Calcutta), where after spending three months at the Hare School he was admitted in St. Xavier’s College, which was both a secondary school and a college. This institute was founded by Belgian Jesuits in 1860. Here Bose came in contact with Father Eugene Lafont (1837-1908), who played an important role in developing a tradition of modern science in Kolkata. With Lafont’s initiative St. Xavier’s College put a special emphasis on science teaching. In 1875 he established a small astronomical observatory in the College. He was one of those principals who persuaded the Calcutta University to offer an undergraduate course in science. Lafont also gave popular science lectures at the Indian Association for the Cultivation of Science, which was established by Mahendra Lal Sircar (1833-1904) in 1876. In fact, he was the first lecturer of the Association. Bose was very much influenced by Lafont. </p>

  <p>In 1879 Bose passed the BA examination in Physical Science Group of the Clacutta University. At the time of his graduation Bose did not have clear plan for his future career except that he wanted to go to England for higher training. However, his father’s economic situation was far from satisfactory for this venture. His father’sinnovative schemes and investment had mostly failed and as a result he was burdened with debts. There were some projects which were successful but then Bose’s father did not make profit out of them. Had Bose’s father kept the shares that he had bought as its founder there would have been no financial difficulty. But he had given away his shares to his poorer friends. Bose decided that his first duty was to earn money and help his father in paying off the debts. Following his father’s example thenatural choice was to join the coveted Indian Civil Service. However, his father did not want his son to become a civilservant, which he thought would take his son away from the common people. In fact, his father wanted that his sonshould be helpful to the common man and which could not be done by becoming a civil servant in British India. Finally it was decided that Bose would study medicine in some English University.</p>
